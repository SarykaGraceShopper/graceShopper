But, sadly, in the dark, cynical, neoliberal and sometimes even neo-nazi times in which we live, people only want dragons who can protect and destroy, leaving kind, sweet, and cute dragon individuals without a pallet to lay on, without even a runty rodent to char and chew. We here at Discount Dragons rescue these sweeties, these cuties, these defenseless huggable sometimes-fire-breathing creatures and bring them to you at a low low price, so that all dragons can find the magical, loving home that they deserve. Will you be their hero???</p>
